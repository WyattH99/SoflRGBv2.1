# SoflRGBv2.1
This repo will keep track of my progress on my Sofl RGB v2.1 Build.

I will be following the build guide provided by beekeeb: https://docs.beekeeb.com/build-guide/sofle-rgb-v2.1-soflekeyboard-build-log-guide-with-photos

Other Helpful Links:
- Nice Nano v2 MCU Info: https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano
- ZMK Firmware Flash Software: https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup

The end goal is to gain experience on the hardware side (soldering) and some software (firmware) for a small project.
The stretch goal is to write my own firmware for the key board.
